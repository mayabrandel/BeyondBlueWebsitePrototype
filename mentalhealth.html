    <h2 class="righttext"><b>MENTAL HEALTH</b></h2> <h3 class="righttext">Having a positive and balanced mental wellbeing is crucial for leading a happy, healthy life for any individual. Mental health can be explained as being an individual’s wellbeing, their ability to cope with everyday life including the different stresses involved to live a rich, productive life with a positive impact on their community around them.<br>
    Having poor mental health can cause many negative impacts on an individual’s life in the social and physical aspects. It can damage relationships between family, friends and the community around them, decreased motivation and daily functioning and in the physical aspect it can lead to health problems and in extreme cases can also lead to premature death from suicide.
